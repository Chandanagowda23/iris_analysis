## Files
1. **iris_analysis.R:**  
   - This R script file contains the code for loading, exploring, and visualizing the Iris dataset.
  
2. **iris.csv:**
   - This CSV file contains the raw Iris dataset.

3. **iris_analysis_report.html:**
   - This HTML file is the knitted report generated from the R script, providing visualizations and interpretations.

4. **README.md:**
   - This file you are currently reading, providing essential information about the project.

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Ensure you have R installed on your machine.
2. Open the `iris_analysis.R` script in your preferred R environment.
3. Run the script to perform the analysis.
4. View the results in the generated `iris_analysis_report.html`.
